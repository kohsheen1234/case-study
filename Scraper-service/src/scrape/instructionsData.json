    "description": "Repair was simple. I unscrewed the old grommet which held the old spray arm and screwed-on the new one. About 30 seconds was required. Other people having this problem should note that the spray-arm is made of three pieces which are inseparable when the arm is new. The arm is sold in this form. However, when your machine is having the problem that the arm falls off, the three pieces become separate. When you want to replace the spray arm, only one new part needs to be ordered because this part encompases all three components.",

I powered down the dishwasher at the circuit breaker and then reached under the dishwasher and pulled away the 2 wires that were attached to each side of the heater element. I removed the two nuts and replaced them with the parts I ordered from partselect.com. I then put the appropriate wires back at the end of the heater element and ran the dishwasher to check for leaks. No leaks... it was fixed.",

When I went to install it, I removed the old washer, and discovered that the old hose would not fit on the replacement dishwasher. I went to the local repair shop, armed with the model and serial #'s. they searched and searched their books and could not find the hose part number. they said \"good luck\" when I left...I went home and looked up the model on your web site, ordered the hose, and in 3 days had the dishwasher installed and running in about 30 minutes...thanks for prompt shipping.. I couldn't believe it arrived so soon...Mowerman",
